# TO-DO - accept long form
# each n is called a unit
# each outcome is called a measurement of interest / measure / outcome

# If desired, group probability pi_j can be specified to vary conditionally
# as a multinomial function of baseline characteristics (2005, 2010)

# Intermittent data are treated as MAR
# non-random attrition
# estimate trajectory group-specific dropout probabilities,
# dropout rates may be higher for units following trajectory of severe illness
# underestimates size of dropout group if not adjusted
